## 3.3 Twitter

The microbit radio can be used to send text over short distances. In this exercise we will try sending text 
messages to microbits in the local area. The same code can be used on each microbit for sending and receiving.

### Example Solution

```python

from microbit import *
import radio

radio.on()

your_tweet = 'hi'

while True:
    if button_a.was_pressed():
	   radio.send(your_tweet)

    received_tweet = radio.receive()

    if received_tweet:
        display.scroll(received_tweet)

```

### Extensions 

* Change the message
* Radio broadcasts to all microbits within reach. Create a private message between two specific microbits.
