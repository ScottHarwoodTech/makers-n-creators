## 3.1 Treasure Hunt

This game uses several microbits to create a treasure hunt game. Create a number of clues to the treasure 
and put them in the all_clues list. Program all but one of the microbits with the beacon code and set 
each one to a different number. Program the final microbit with the receiver code.

### Example Solution

#### Beacon

```python 

from microbit import *
import radio

all_clues = [
    "Walk Fifteen paces east",
    "Ten paces north",
    "Walk forwards",
    "Look under the seat",
    "Hooray, you win!"
]

clue_count = len(all_clues)
clue = 1

radio.on()

while True:
    # decrease clue number
    if button_a.was_pressed():
        clue = max(clue - 1, 1)
   # increase clue number
    elif button_b.was_pressed():
        clue = min(clue +  1, clue_count)
       
    # broadcast the current clue
    else:
        clue_text = str(clue) + ":" + all_clues[clue - 1]
        radio.send(clue_text)

    display.show(str(clue))
    sleep(1000)

```

#### Receiver

```python

from microbit import *
import radio

# starting clue
clue = "hint: Walk around to find the first clue"
display.scroll(clue)
next_clue = 1

radio.on()

while True:
    display.show("?")
    
    # are we near any clue beacons?
    message = radio.receive()

    if message:
        # picked up a clue !
        number, text = message.split(":")
        # is it the one we want?
        if int(number) == next_clue:
            clue = "clue " + str(number) + ":" + text
            next_clue += 1
            display.scroll(clue)

    sleep(100)

```

### Extensions 

* Change the receiver to remind you about the last clue
* Draw a starting image
* Draw an image to show when the beacon is broadcasting.
