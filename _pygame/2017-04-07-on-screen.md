### Boundaries

What happens at the edges of the screen?

    # keep the box on the screen
    if box_left < 0: box_left = 0
    if box_top < 0:  box_top = 0
    if box_left + box_width > game_width: box_left = game_width - box_width
    if box_top + box_height > game_height: box_top = game_height - box_height
