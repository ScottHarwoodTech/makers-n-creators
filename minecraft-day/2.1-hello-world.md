## 2.1 Hello world

```python

import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

message = "hello, minecraft world"
mc.postToChat(message)

```

### Extensions

* Change the code to read in a message from the console using raw_input()
* Ask for the player's name and write that out with the message.
* Use a while loop to keep writing messages to the chat window.

message = raw_input("enter a message")
