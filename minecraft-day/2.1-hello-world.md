## 2.1 Hello world

In order to be considered professional python programmers on the Raspberry Pi, we have to
do the time-honored hello world in Minecraft.

Start up an instance of Pi Minecraft and a terminal window. Write a program to send a
hello world message to the minecraft console.

### Example Solution

```python

import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft

world = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

message = "hello, minecraft world"
world.postToChat(message)

```

### Extensions

* Change the code to read in a message from the console

```python

message = raw_input("enter a message") # or input in Python 3.x

```

* Ask for the player's name and write that out in the message.
* Use a while loop to keep writing messages to the chat window.
