## Raspberry PI Cheatsheet

Raspberry Pi needs a power adapter, monitor with HDMI connection (or an adapter for VGA), keyboard and mouse.

Connect it all up and connect power last. The Pi will boot automatically and stop after a minute or so
at an admin login prompt.

Type in the default user admin name (pi) and the password (raspberry). Note that
the password field does not show any feedback, it doesn't move the cursor or show
stars for each character like you would see on Windows.

Once logged in, run the next command "startx" to boot the windowing system.
