## 2.1 Frozen

One  of  the  benefits  of programming is that it can automate decision making.
This  saves  us  time and allows us to create rules that our programs must follow.

In   this   guide   weâ€™ll   use Python code to freeze any blocks of water below the
player.   By  using  decision making in Python,  we can avoid  freezing  any  other
blocks than water. By making small changes to the  code  you  can  change the  effect  of  the  program
quite drastically. For example you could make the program change grass to gold. Try
coming  up  with  your own ideas!

```python

import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft
import time

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

while True:
  time.sleep(0.2)
  pos = mc.player.getPos()
  x = pos.x
  y = pos.y
  z = pos.z

  blockBelow = mc.getBlock(x, y - 1, z)

  water = 9
  ice = 79

  if blockBelow == water:
    mc.setBlock(x, y - 1, z, ice)

```

### Extensions

* Change the code to change whatever you walk on to a different block type (lava - block 10).
* Change every block except air (!= 0) to ice
* Change the code to change blocks you touch to gold.
