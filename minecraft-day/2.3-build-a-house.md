## 2.3 Building a House

In this challenge we will build a simple, single story house with a flat roof. We could
build a house with a loop to place every block but a nice easy way to do it is to use
the setBlocks function to quickly build a solid cube shape of one block type.
This way we can create a solid block then hollow out the insides using the same method
but using an air block to give a living area.

### Example Solution

```python

import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft

world = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

x = 10
y = 11
z = 12

# width, height and depth
x2 = x + 10
y2 = y + 5
z2 = z + 8

stone_block_id = 4 # cobble stones
air_block_id = 0

world.setBlocks(x, y, z, x2, y2, z2, stone_block_id)
world.setBlocks(x + 1, y + 1, z + 1, x2 - 1, y2 - 1, z2 - 1, air_block_id)

```

### Extensions

* Change the depth, width and height of the house.
* Change the code to use a different block type.
* Add a door so that the player can go in and out.
* Build the house around the player using their current position.
* Add a pitched roof /\ onto the house using a different block type.
* Add a chimney on the roof.
