## 2.3 Building a House

3. Warehouse
When   you’re   building in Minecraft you can spend ages on a relatively simple  structure,  such  as
the  walls  of  your  house. Wouldn’t  it  be  nice  if  you could save time?  Well, you can do that with only a few
lines of Python.

In  this  guide  you’ll  learn how to use maths operators in Python to create the basic structure for a house. You’ll
create a hollow box of block, which you can build upon to create your own ideas with more speed.

You can have loads of fun adapting this code.   Come up with your own ideas and try changing the block types
or combining it with other bits of code from other exercises.

### Example Solution

```python

import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

block = 4 # cobble stones
air = 0

x = 10
y = 11
z = 12

# width, height and depth

x2 = x + 10
y2 = y + 5
z2 = z + 8

# create a cuboid
mc.setBlocks(x, y, z, x2, y2, z2, block)

# Create air blocks inside
mc.setBlocks(x + 1, y + 1, z + 1, x2 - 1, y2 - 1, z2 - 1, air)

```

### Extensions

* Change the block types of the blocks being placed. A popular block type for the
inside is lava (value 11) with an surrounding of glass (value 20).

* Make a swimming pool. Change the values on the maths op-erators used in the
setBlocks() function on line 13 so that there is no top roof created and fill with water ?
