## 2.5 Creeper

In honour of Halloween, we will create a spooky block that follows us around.
Once you have the code working, you can build on the basic spooky block and make it
into a minecraft creeper, a weeping angel from Dr Who or a ghost.

Write a program to create a block a little bit away from your player's current
position. Each time you move, have the spooky block move a little bit closer to
where you are.

Hint: Easiest way follow is to change remove the block at the current position by
changing it to "air" and rebuild the block at the new location.

### Extensions

* Add more blocks to make a recognizable spooky figure to follow you around.
* Remember to erase the old blocks before building the figure with the new blocks

### Example Solution

```python

import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft
import mcpi.block as block
import time


# build the figure using the given material
def build_spooky_figure(world, position, material):
	# simple block for now
	world.setBlock(position.x, position.y, position.z, material)

world = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

lastPlayerPos = world.player.getTilePos()

# create the spooky block
blockPos = lastPlayerPos.x, lastPlayerPos.y, lastPlayerPos.z + 20
build_spooky_figure(world, blockPos, block.STONE.id)

while True:

	time.sleep(5)

	playerPos = world.player.getTilePos()
	# has the player moved ?
  if playerPos != lastPlayerPos:
  	playersPath.append(playerPos)
  	lastPlayerPos = playerPos

		# remove the spooky block from old position by building
		# over the existing figure with "air"
		build_spooky_figure(world, blockPos, block.AIR.id)

		# move it to new position
		blockPos = lastPlayerPos
		# build it in stone
		build_spooky_figure(world, blockPos, block.STONE.id)

```
