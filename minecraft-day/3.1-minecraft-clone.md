## 3.1 Minecraft Clone

Michael Fogleman has written a clone of minecraft in python which you can run as a single, stand-alone program on a laptop. In this session, we will 
get the program running, make changes to the python code and see what we can change in the world. 


### Prerequisites

Download the program main.py and texture.png from https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft. Follow the instructions for building and running.

### Randomness

Keep a copy of the main.py file in case you ever want to go back to the unmodified version. 

When the program starts up, it automatically generates some hills, trees etc.

### Create new block types

### make soil under the grass

### build a tunnel under the ground
