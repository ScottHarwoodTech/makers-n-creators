## 1.1 Dog Years

Dogs are said to live 7 years for every human year. Write a program to calculate how old a person is in dog years.

### Example Solution

```python

name = input('What is your name ?')
age = input('How old are you ?')
age = int(age)

print("If " + name + " was a dog, they'd be " + str(age * 7) + " years old")

```
