# Number variables

We can also use numbers in variables.

~~~

age = 25
print(age)

~~~

We can convert a number to text using the str() function and convert text to a number using the int() function.


Write a program to read in your name and age, convert your age to dog years, then print it out.

~~~

name = input('What is your name ?')
age = input('How old are you ?')
age = int(age)

print('If ' + name + ' was a dog, they'd be ' + str(age * 7) ' years old')

~~~

Notice age conversion between text and number using int.
